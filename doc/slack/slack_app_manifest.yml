  long_description: SHA-256 is a hash function that works like a fingerprint for files. It converts any text into a 256-bit code. So if anything in the file changes, even a single character, the hash generated will be different. This is very useful (among other things) for checking whether a file has been modified by comparing the current hash with a previous one.
