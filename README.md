# HashWatcher üîç
Monitors, detects, and notifies changes in files (using SHA-256)

Scenarios where HashWatcher can be useful:
- Security Monitoring: Detect unauthorized changes to critical system or configuration files.
- Configuration Management: Track changes in configuration files to ensure they are intentional and documented.
- Software Development: Monitor source code or project files for unexpected modifications

## Requirements üîó
<b>Supported OS</b>:
- Linux
- Windows
- macOS (n√©e OS X, aka Darwin)
- OpenBSD
- DragonFly BSD
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- Solaris

<b>To build</b>:
- Go compiler

## Quick usage guide üìö
#### Build:
```
go build -o hash-watcher cmd/main.go
```

<br>

> <b>NOTE</b>: Generate in the root directory of the project

---

#### Configuring targets:
Currently, you must create a JSON configuration file for each directory you wish to monitor. Put the file in a non-intrusive directory and name it as you wish. The JSON must follow the structure below:
```json
{
  "directoryPath": "/full/path/to/directory/",
  "fileNames": [],
  "checkFrequencyInSeconds": 30
}

```

You can also filter by specific file:
```json
"fileNames": [
  "file-1.txt",
  "file-2.txt"
],
```

---

#### Usage example:
```
./hash-watcher /full/path/to/configuration/file/settings.json
```

The  `file-1.txt` was initially empty. Upon adding the letter 'X', the change was detected (after 60 seconds), and the hash comparison triggered a notification:

```
2024/07/08 19:59:20 => Watching...

2024/07/08 20:00:50 => file-1.txt was modified! 
  - Before: 01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b 
  - Now: 7058299627365fc7a3dd7840fd3d56f29306cd30c0f2c13cb500fe79617290ff
```

## Future plans üìå
- Check sub-directories
- Create customized schedules
- Write unit and functional tests
- Implement support for notifications in Slack channels
